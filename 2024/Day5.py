# Santa Claus's elves üßùüßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è have found a bunch of mismatched magic boots in the workshop. Each boot is described by two values:

# type indicates if it's a left boot (I) or a right boot (R).
# size indicates the size of the boot.
# Your task is to help the elves pair all the boots of the same size having a left and a right one. To do this, you should return a list of the available boots after pairing them.

# Note: You can have more than one pair of boots of the same size!

#   { type: 'I', size: 41 },
#   { type: 'I', size: 42 }
# ]

# organizeShoes(shoes)
