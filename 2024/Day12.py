# You are in a very special market where Christmas trees ðŸŽ„ are sold. 
# Each one comes decorated with a series of very peculiar ornaments, 
# and the price of the tree is determined by the ornaments it has.

# *: Snowflake - Value: 1
# o: Christmas Ball - Value: 5
# ^: Decorative Tree - Value: 10
# #: Shiny Garland - Value: 50
# @: Polar Star - Value: 100
# Normally, you would sum up all the values of the ornaments and that's itâ€¦

# But, watch out! If an ornament is immediately to the left of another of greater value, 
# instead of adding, its value is subtracted.
